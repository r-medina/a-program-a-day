# A Program A Day

In light of the current situation (COVID-19 + social-distancing + isolation),
I've decided to write a program every day. This will give me focus, keep my
spirits up, and will helpfully teach me something.

## Programs

### Day 1: [`magor`](01-magor/)

`magor` is a program that takes as input some number (as a string) and returns
the consonant sounds associated with those numbers according to the [major
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system). These sounds can
be used to create words which help memorize the number. More info
[in the README](01-magor/README.md)!
