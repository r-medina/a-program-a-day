# A Program A Day

In light of the current situation (COVID-19 + social-distancing + isolation),
I've decided to write a program every day. This will give me focus, keep my
spirits up, and will helpfully teach me something.

Notes:

- Day 2 was a Sunday and I didn't produce any code. I did, however, [do research
  into various emacs features](02-hl-linum/README.md) to figure out how to do
  the project i wanted to complete. My insight is that I don't need to produce a
  program daily, but I should start or research and write about it daily.

## Programs

### Day 1: [`magor`](01-magor/)

`magor` is a program that takes as input some number (as a string) and returns
the consonant sounds associated with those numbers according to the [major
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system). These sounds can
be used to create words which help memorize the number. More info
[in the README](01-magor/README.md)!

### Day 2-3: [`hl-linum`](02-hl-linum/)
